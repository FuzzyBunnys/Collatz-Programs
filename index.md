## Orbit Counting Programs
The [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is a simple problem that has bedevilled mathematicians for a very long time. In brief, pick any positive integer that is not 0, if it's even divide it by 2, if it's odd multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process ad infinitum, the conjecture asks if every number eventually reduces to 1. So far no counterexamples have been found and a lot of numbers have been tested, but there is no proof of the conjecture. This repository consists of two programs written in C using Netbeans that investigate the conjecture. 

### [Collatz Map](https://github.com/FuzzyBunnys/Collatz-Programs/tree/main/Collatz%20Map)
This program tests the first two hundred odd integers, though it can easily be extended by modifying the variable of the main for loop. 
### [Limited Collatz Map](https://github.com/FuzzyBunnys/Collatz-Programs/tree/main/Limited%20Collatz%20Map)
This program tests the first two hundred odd integers as well
